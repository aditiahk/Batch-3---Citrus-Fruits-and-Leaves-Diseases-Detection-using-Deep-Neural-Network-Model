# Batch-3---Citrus-Fruits-and-Leaves-Diseases-Detection-using-Deep-Neural-Network-Model
Citrus Fruits and Leaves Diseases Detection using Deep Neural Network Model - A CNN model with a simple user friendly GUI which detects the diseases in citrus fruits and leaves through images 

ENVIRONMENTAL SETUP
-------------------
To perform deep learning on citrus fruits and leaves dataser, the software/program requires a computer system powerful enough to handle the computing power necessary. So the following minimum specs are required:
1) Central Processing Unit (CPU) — Intel Core i5 6th Generation processor or higher. An AMD equivalent processor will also be optimal.
2) RAM — 8 GB minimum, 16 GB or higher is recommended.
3) Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) — Google COlaboratory GPU 
4) Operating System — Microsoft Windows 10 (64-bit recommended) Pro or Home
5) Python 3.10 
6) Python IDLE
7) Google Colaboratory
8) Jupyter Notebook
9) Anaconda Navigator 
10) Python Libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, Keras, Tkinter
